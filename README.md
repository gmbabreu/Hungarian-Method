# Hungarian-Method

Program that solves Assignment Problem for matrices using the Hungarian Method. The model is based on Harold Kuhn's paper "A tale of three eras". 

In order to solve a matrix, simply put in your desired values in the Hungarian Method.py file. The model works best for smaller sized matrices, with 2 or 3 dimensions.  It can both maximize or minimize the given matrix, and unless specified, will always work with minimization
